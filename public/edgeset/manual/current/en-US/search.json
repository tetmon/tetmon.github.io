    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to the community of data-driven organizations.\nAs easy to use as a Data Science notebook. EdgeSet uses a simple and familiar notebook interface inspired by popular data science and analysis tools. Connecting to a data source is as simple as filling in the connection details. You can use the same SQL dialect to query any data source—even if the data source isn’t a SQL database.\nAs powerful as a Big Data cluster. EdgeSet can connect to any number of data sources and combine data from these sources in a single query. By pushing queries down to the sources, EdgeSet turns your scattered data sources into a distributed parallel data processing fabric.",

    "text": "9.1 Restricted by default\nEdgeSet allows you to control access for each data source down to the column level. The permissions system is designed to make it simple to “democratize” access to data: to grant broad access to everyone in the organization but restrict access to sensitive data to a small set of trusted users. However, you can still use EdgeSet’s permission systems to manage more conservative and restrictive permissions.\nTo show how the permissions system works, we’ll start by adding Edgeset’s internal PostgreSQL database as a data source.\nAfter adding the edgeset data source and restarting the query engine, you can see the edgeset data source in the permissions panel. As edgeset is a new data source, it does not have any permissions assigned yet. All data sources can always be accessed by admins though.\nEdgeSet is designed to protect your sensitive data. EdgeSet doesn’t grant access to new data sources to anyone except admins until you’ve told it to. You can review the data and add all desired schema, table, and/or column-level restrictions before granting access to non-admins.\nWe will show how to grant access first to make the permissions system easier to understand, but you should apply restrictions before granting access to data sources.",

For example, restricting access to a schema means that the tables and columns in that schema will be restricted as well. This also means that restrictions applied to a lower level object must be limited to the set of restricted groups and users at a higher level. For example, if you’ve restricted access to the edgeset schema to admin users only, it would not make sense to restrict a table in the edgeset schema to analysts since analysts are already restricted from accessing the schema.",

The size of the EdgeSet server must scale with the number of concurrent queries it can run, rather than the amount of data it has access to.\nThe primary method of scaling EdgeSet for most data sources is through read replicas.

The data does not have to be prepared especially for EdgeSet; EdgeSet can infer appropriate tables from the files automatically.\nWhenever the query engine is restarted, EdgeSet retrieves a file listing from each connected cloud storage system. It then samples data from each file to determine if it’s a supported file. If so, it infers the names and types of each column. Finally, it collects matching (partitioned) files and creates tables from them.\nEach column of a tabular file can be of a certain type, such as integers or dates. EdgeSet will automatically infer the type of a column if all sampled cells in that column match a given type. (Note: We will use the term “cell” to refer to an individual row and column of any tabular file, whether it’s a spreadsheet or not).\nWhitespace1 is stripped from the beginning and end of each cell when inferring its type and converting it to a value.",
