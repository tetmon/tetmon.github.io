EdgeSet uses a simple and familiar notebook interface inspired by popular data science and analysis tools. Connecting to a data source is as simple as filling in the connection details. You can use the same SQL dialect to query any data source—even if the data source isn’t a SQL database.\nAs powerful as a Big Data cluster. EdgeSet can connect to any number of data sources and combine data from these sources in a single query. By pushing queries down to the sources, EdgeSet turns your scattered data sources into a distributed parallel data processing fabric.",

The data does not have to be prepared especially for EdgeSet; EdgeSet can infer appropriate tables from the files automatically.\nWhenever a data source is scanned, EdgeSet retrieves a file listing from it. It then samples data from each file to determine if it’s a supported file. If so, it infers the names and types of each column. Finally, it collects matching (partitioned) files and creates tables from them.\nEach column of a tabular file can be of a certain type, such as integers or dates. EdgeSet will automatically infer the type of a column if all sampled cells in that column match a given type. (Note: We will use the term “cell” to refer to an individual row and column of any tabular file, whether it’s a spreadsheet or not).\nWhitespace1 is stripped from the beginning and end of each cell when inferring its type and converting it to a value.",

All string comparison and sorting is done by comparing unicode code points literally. For case-insensitive comparison, you can use LOWER(), UPPER(), or case-insensitive regular expressions. Note that these functions don’t support languages that have ambiguous case conversion (i.e. where one lowercase character could be represented various uppercase versions), but that should only be an issue if dealing with Eastern European languages.",
