## **1\. Information We Collect**

When you use our website or contact us through live chat, we may collect:

* **Contact information** (e.g. name, email address, company name — if you choose to provide it).

* **Messages and chat content** you send to us via live chat.

* **Technical data** (e.g. IP address, browser type, device information, and pages visited).

## **3\. Live Chat Services**

Our website uses **Chatwoot** to provide real-time live chat support. When you use live chat, Chatwoot processes the messages and related metadata (such as IP address and browser details) on our behalf so we can respond to your requests.

## **6\. Data Retention**

We keep your personal information only as long as necessary to:

* Fulfil the purposes outlined above.
